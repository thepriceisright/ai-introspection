    "# Reproducing *Emergent Introspective Awareness in LLMs* — End‑to‑End Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook runs the four experiments from the paper and recreates the **layer‑wise** plots using the harness you downloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this notebook does**  \n",
    "1. Unpacks/sets up the harness (or uses an existing `src/` in this working directory).  \n",
    "2. Installs dependencies.  \n",
    "3. Lets you choose a model and runtime (4‑bit/8‑bit/FP16).  \n",
    "4. Runs:\n",
    "   - **Injected thoughts** (layer/strength sweep)\n",
    "   - **Thought vs text**\n",
    "   - **Prefill intention**\n",
    "   - **Intentional control**\n",
    "5. Produces **layer‑wise plots** that match the paper’s figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sources from the paper** (Appendix) this notebook aligns to:\n",
    "- Concept vectors on the *final `:` token* in `Human: Tell me about {word}\\nAssistant:` and subtracting the mean baseline over 100 words (pp. **36–37**).  \n",
    "- Injection windows and experiment prompts (pp. **38–42**, **48–58**).  \n",
    "- Layer‑wise lines and typical peaks (pp. **15**, **21**, **24**, **28–29**).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: Exact **numbers** may differ (you’re using open‑source HF models; the paper used Anthropic internal models), but you should recover the **qualitative phenomena** and **layer/strength** trends.\n"
